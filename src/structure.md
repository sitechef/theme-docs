# Folder Structure

The command `sitechef init` downloads and expands your selected theme locally.

This is the default theme folder structure:

    gulpfile.js   # Settings for Gulp asset compilation
    package.json  # Node.js configuration file
    preferences.scss # Auto-generated scss file with your site preferences
    theme.json    #Â Editable Configuration for the theme (see below)
    .sitechefrc   # Settings for the sitechef CLI (see below)
    coffee/       # Any source coffeescript files to be compiled by gulp
        app.coffee # Entry-point for compiling coffeescript assets
    dist/         # the public folder made available to website visitors
      css/        # Any additional css files NOT generated by SCSS files
      js/         # Compiled javascript/coffeescript files
      img/        # Any image files required by the theme (NOT user content)
    gulpTasks/    # Individual settings for gulp tasks eg. template creation...
    js/           # Any source javascript files to be compiled by gulp
        app.js    # Entry-point for compiling Browserify frontend assets
    lib/          # Any 3rd party libraries used in coffee/js compilation
    sassLibraries/ # Any 3rd party SCSS/SASS libraries used in SCSS compilation
    scss/         # SCSS Stylesheet files - customise the style here
        defaults.scss  # The theme defaults which can be overriden by a user later
        theme.scss     # The main scss file for the theme
        ...            # Other scss/sass files included in theme.scss
    templates/    # HTML template files
        index.html # Main entry-point for the theme
        comingSoon.html # Entrypoint for when 'coming soon' is set to on
        voucherEmail.html # template for generating the voucher email receipt
        voucher.html # template for the voucher
        ...       # other html files included in index.html
    .sitechef/    # Configuration data for sitechef [Do not edit]
# Config Files

# Version Control

As yet, SiteChef does not offer any inbuilt version control so executing
`sitechef publish` will overwrite the existing theme.

We *highly* recommend you use version control in order to prevent inadvertent data loss. Our initial setup comes ready for [GIT](http://git-scm.com/).

If you are not familiar with version control, we recommend that
you try GIT. Atlassian have created [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) which is easy-to-use desktop version of GIT that integrates nicely with [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) or [Github](https://www.github.com) which both offer free hosting of repositories. Bitbucket offer free private repositories.

The default SiteChef themes come ready with a `.gitignore` file, prepopulated to ignore temporary files like "tmp", "node_modules" and the SiteChef configuration directory ".sitechef"
