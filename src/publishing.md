# Publish Your Theme

Before publishing your theme, ensure that all pages load correctly without
javascript or css errors.

We highly recommend trying your theme on a number of browsers first.

Ensure that you run `sitechef serve` at least once before the final publish to
check that everything works.

Once ready to publish execute `sitechef publish`.

Your theme will now be published back to SiteChef and be available on your or
your client's website.
