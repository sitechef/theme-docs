The command `sitechef init` downloads and expands your selected theme locally.

This is the default structure:

    theme.json    #Â Editable Configuration for the theme
    package.json  # Node.js configuration file
    gulpfile.js   # Settings for Gulp asset compilation
    templates/    # HTML template files
        index.html # Main entry-point for the theme
        ...       # other html files included in index.html
    scss/         # SCSS Stylesheet files - customise the style here
        defaults.scss  # The theme defaults which can be overriden by a user later
        theme.scss     # The main scss file for the theme
        ...            # Other scss/sass files included in theme.scss
    js/           # Any source javascript files to be compiled by gulp
    coffee/       # Any source coffeescript files to be compiled by gulp
    lib/          # Any 3rd party libraries used in coffee/js compilation
    sassLibraries/ # Any 3rd party SCSS/SASS libraries used in SCSS compilation
    dist/         # the public folder made available to website visitors
      css/        # Any additional css files NOT generated by SCSS files
      js/         # Compiled javascript/coffeescript files
      img/        # Any image files required by the theme (NOT user content)
    gulpTasks/    # Individual settings for gulp tasks eg. template creation...

#The .sitechefrc file

When placed at the root of the theme directory, the `.sitechefrc` file
provides advanced configuration options for the SiteChef CLI.

It is a JSON file with the following fields:

    {
      /**
       * ignore: an array of folders that SiteChef
       *         should not publish back to the server
       *         Include any private files or files
       *         that are generated on installation
       */
      "ignore": [
        "node_modules",
        "anyFilesStartingWith*",
        "anyPathStartingWith**"
      ],
      /**
       * compileCommand: an array of the sections of
       *          the relative path that will be executed
       *          on "sitechef serve"
       *          In the example below, it will execute
       *          "./node_modules/.bin/gulp"
       *          If you wish to use an alternative asset
       *          generation tool like grunt, the array would
       *          be: ["grunt watch"]
       */
      "compileCommand":[
        "node_modules",
        ".bin",
        "gulp"
      ]
    }

#Version Control

As yet, SiteChef does not offer any inbuilt version control so executing
`sitechef publish` will overwrite the existing theme.

We *highly* recommend you use version control in order to prevent inadvertent data loss. Our initial setup comes ready for [GIT](http://git-scm.com/).

If you are not familiar with version control, we recommend that
you try GIT. Atlassian have created [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) which is easy-to-use desktop version of GIT that integrates nicely with [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) or [Github](https://www.github.com) which both offer free hosting of repositories. Bitbucket offer free private repositories.

The default SiteChef themes come ready with a `.gitignore` file, prepopulated to ignore temporary files like "tmp", "node_modules" and the SiteChef configuration directory ".sitechef"
